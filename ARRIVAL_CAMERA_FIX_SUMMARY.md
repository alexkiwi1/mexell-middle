# Arrival Detection Camera Fix - Deployment Summary

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Backup Location**: `/root/mexell-middle/backups/arrival-camera-fix-20251022_011441/`

## Problem

**Issue**: Aashir Ali (assigned to desk_43 on employees_05) was showing arrival video from admin_office camera instead of his assigned desk camera.

**Root Cause**: The arrival detection logic was filtering detections by assigned desk zone only, but not validating that the camera matched. If an employee was detected in multiple zones/cameras, the system would use the earliest detection regardless of camera.

## Solution

Modified `calculateArrivalTime()` function in `/root/mexell-middle/src/services/employees.service.js` to enforce **BOTH** zone AND camera matching.

### Key Changes

1. **Filter by Zone First**: Only consider detections at the assigned desk zone
2. **Determine Primary Camera**: Find which camera has the most detections at that desk
3. **Filter by Camera**: ONLY use detections from the primary camera
4. **Result**: Arrival time and video now match the correct camera

### Code Logic Flow

```javascript
// STEP 1: Filter by assigned desk zone
const deskZoneDetections = allDetections.filter(detection =>
  detection.zones && detection.zones.includes(assignedDesk)
);

// STEP 2: Determine primary camera (most detections at this desk)
const cameraCounts = {};
deskZoneDetections.forEach(d => {
  cameraCounts[d.camera] = (cameraCounts[d.camera] || 0) + 1;
});
const assignedCamera = Object.keys(cameraCounts).reduce((a, b) => 
  cameraCounts[a] > cameraCounts[b] ? a : b
);

// STEP 3: Filter to ONLY use detections from assigned camera + zone
const validDetections = deskZoneDetections.filter(detection =>
  detection.camera === assignedCamera
);
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
| Employee | Assigned Desk | Assigned Camera | Arrival Time | Arrival Camera | Status |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Aashir Ali | desk_43 | employees_05 | ~15:00 | admin_office | ❌ WRONG |

### After Fix
| Employee | Assigned Desk | Assigned Camera | Arrival Time | Arrival Camera | Status |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Aashir Ali | desk_43 | employees_05 | 15:39:08 | employees_05 | ✅ CORRECT |

### Log Output
```
info: Aashir Ali: Using 10 detections at desk_43 on camera employees_05 (filtered from 120 total)
warn: Aashir Ali: Person detection at assigned desk - fallback to first detection (only 10s cumulative)
info: Aashir Ali: Arrival via person_at_desk (confidence: low, detections: 10)
```

### API Response
```json
{
  "name": "Aashir Ali",
  "assigned_desk": "desk_43",
  "arrival_time": "2025-10-21T15:39:08.285+05:00",
  "arrival_camera": "employees_05",
  "arrival_zones": "desk_43",
  "first_seen": "2025-10-21T15:39:08.285+05:00"
}
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ Arrival detection now matches BOTH zone AND camera
2. ✅ Video URLs show correct camera feed
3. ✅ Eliminates false arrivals from employees passing through other zones
4. ✅ More accurate attendance tracking
5. ✅ Better logging shows detection filtering details

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, restore from backup:

```bash
BACKUP_DIR="/root/mexell-middle/backups/arrival-camera-fix-20251022_011441"

# Restore file
cp "$BACKUP_DIR/employees.service.js" /root/mexell-middle/src/services/employees.service.js

# Deploy
docker cp /root/mexell-middle/src/services/employees.service.js \
  mexell-middle-node-app-1:/usr/src/node-app/src/services/employees.service.js

# Restart
docker restart mexell-middle-node-app-1
```

## No Regressions Detected

Tested multiple employees and all show correct arrival times and cameras:
- Kinza Amin: desk_02, arrived 12:24
- Nimra Ghulam Fareed: desk_04, arrived 13:02
- Summaiya Khan: desk_05, arrived 12:38
- Arifa Dhari: desk_06, arrived 12:08
- Khalid Ahmed: desk_07, arrived 14:53
- Muhammad Arsalan: desk_09, arrived 13:07
- Aashir Ali: desk_43, arrived 15:39 ✅ (FIXED)

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY**

The arrival detection now correctly validates BOTH the assigned desk zone AND the camera that covers that zone. This ensures that arrival videos show the employee at their actual assigned desk, not from passing through admin_office, reception, or other areas.
