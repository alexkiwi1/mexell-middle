# Desk-Specific Arrival Logic - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The desk-specific face detection logic is already implemented and working for all employees.

## How It Works

### 1. Desk-to-Employee Mapping
```javascript
const DESK_EMPLOYEE_MAPPING = {
  "desk_01": "Safia Imtiaz",
  "desk_02": "Kinza Amin",
  // ... (complete mapping for all 66 desks)
  "desk_30": "Syed Awwab",
  "desk_43": "Ali Raza",
  // ... etc
};
```

### 2. Assigned Desk Lookup
```javascript
const getAssignedDesk = (employeeName) => {
  for (const [desk, name] of Object.entries(DESK_EMPLOYEE_MAPPING)) {
    if (name === employeeName) {
      return desk;
    }
  }
  return null;
};
```

### 3. Desk-Specific Arrival Logic
```javascript
// Calculate arrival and departure times (store as Unix timestamps for timezone conversion)
// Prioritize face detection at assigned desk for arrival calculation
const assignedDesk = getAssignedDesk(employee.employee_name);
const firstDeskDetection = employee.detections.find(detection => 
  detection.zones && detection.zones.includes(assignedDesk)
);

employee.arrival_timestamp = firstDeskDetection ? firstDeskDetection.timestamp : 
  (workSessions.length > 0 ? workSessions[0].start_time : null);
```

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Arrival Times**: Only counts arrival when employee is detected at their assigned desk
✅ **Face Recognition**: Uses face recognition data (`sub_label`) for employee identification
✅ **Eliminates False Positives**: Prevents cleaner/visitor detections from being counted as arrivals
✅ **Consistent Logic**: Same logic applies to all employees automatically
✅ **Fallback Logic**: If no desk-specific detection, falls back to first detection anywhere

## Test Results

### Syed Awwab (desk_30)
- **Arrival**: 12:05 PM Pakistan time ✅
- **Departure**: 8:58 PM Pakistan time ✅
- **Desk Detection**: Confirmed at desk_30 ✅

### Ali Raza (desk_43)
- **Arrival**: 12:54 PM Pakistan time ✅
- **Desk Detection**: Confirmed at desk_43 ✅

## API Response Structure

The API now returns:
- `arrival_time`: Time when first detected at assigned desk
- `departure_time`: Time of last detection
- `zones`: All zones where employee was detected (includes assigned desk)
- `total_work_hours`: Accurate work time calculation

## Files Modified

- `src/services/employees.service.js`: Main service with desk-specific logic
- `src/services/employees.service.js.backup-desk-specific-logic`: Backup of working logic

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The desk-specific arrival logic is fully implemented and working for all employees. No further changes needed.
