# API Desk Information - Added to Employee Work Hours

## ✅ New Fields Added

The employee work hours API now includes assigned desk information for each employee.

### New Response Fields:

1. **`assigned_desk`**: The desk ID assigned to the employee (e.g., "desk_07", "desk_30")
2. **`assigned_desk_camera`**: The camera where the employee was detected at their assigned desk (e.g., "employees_02", "employees_06")

### Example API Response:

```json
{
  "name": "Khalid Ahmed",
  "assigned_desk": "desk_07",
  "assigned_desk_camera": "employees_02",
  "arrival": "2025-10-20T15:01:45.079+05:00",
  "departure": "2025-10-20T22:01:21.033+05:00",
  "cameras": ["employees_04", "employees_02", "reception", "employees_03", "employees_06"],
  "zones": ["employee_area", "desk_18", "desk_23", "desk_27", "desk_22", "desk_07", "desk_08", "desk_04", "desk_02", "desk_11", "desk_05", "desk_01", "desk_06", "desk_09", "desk_36", "desk_19", "desk_20", "desk_26", "desk_64"],
  "sessions": [...]
}
```

### Field Explanations:

- **`assigned_desk`**: Always shows the employee's assigned desk (e.g., "desk_07" for Khalid Ahmed)
- **`assigned_desk_camera`**: Shows the camera where the employee was first detected at their assigned desk
- **`assigned_desk_camera: null`**: If the employee was never detected at their assigned desk (no arrival recorded)

### Use Cases:

1. **Desk Assignment Verification**: Confirm which desk each employee is assigned to
2. **Camera Coverage Analysis**: See which camera detected the employee at their desk
3. **Attendance Validation**: Verify employees are arriving at their correct assigned desk
4. **Zone Coverage**: Understand which cameras cover which desks

### Examples:

```json
// Employee detected at assigned desk
{
  "name": "Khalid Ahmed",
  "assigned_desk": "desk_07",
  "assigned_desk_camera": "employees_02",
  "arrival": "2025-10-20T15:01:45.079+05:00"
}

// Employee not detected at assigned desk
{
  "name": "Abdul Qayoom",
  "assigned_desk": "desk_14",
  "assigned_desk_camera": null,
  "arrival": null
}
```

## Benefits:

✅ **Clear Desk Assignment**: Easy to see which desk each employee is assigned to
✅ **Camera Coverage**: Understand which camera covers each desk
✅ **Attendance Validation**: Confirm employees are at their correct desk
✅ **Overlapping Coverage**: Handle multiple cameras covering the same desk
✅ **No Arrival Tracking**: Clear indication when employees don't arrive at assigned desk

This enhancement provides complete visibility into desk assignments and camera coverage for comprehensive employee tracking.
